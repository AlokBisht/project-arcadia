## Idea1: Produce subprimes

### Problem
Can we have a create a mathmatical subsystem within the math system, in which we can produce prime numbers quickly without much computation and vice versa be 100% sure of a number without doing prime factorization.

### Solution
If there exist a system S where natural numbers starts from N. In such system the numbers between N and N + N are definatly prime. i.e. if we assume the axiom that 100 is the minimum number that exist in our subsytem, the numbers between 100 and 200 are definatly prime. 

surely if we do operations like (N + 1) - N or (N / N), we can see there exist number 1 there but this can be controlled using new axioms where such operation are undefined. so we need other axioms as well with the mimimum natural number axiom to make our subsystem stable.

### Applications
#### Computer programs:
We can create new mathmatical axioms in this subsystem in the computer program where we can start minimum number from any number greater than 1. Such systems can be used to represent the strings.
